## What is it?

This is a [NX Monorepo](https://nx.dev) that will provide you with a Doughnut API. When you build this project it will fetch donuts being sold at [Boxcar Donuts](https://www.bxcrdonuts.ca/) 

It will include names, descriptions, prices, images and if its a special doughnut meaning that its available for a limited time or if its a standard doughnut.

## Setup & Run the Application

Simply run the `yarn` command

```bash
yarn start
```

## APIS

The following APIs are available 

```bash
# Return all doughnuts
/doughnuts 

# Return a single doughnut
/doughnuts/:dounughtId
```
